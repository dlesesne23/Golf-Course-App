# Golf-Course-Locator
This system lets you track and rate golf courses that you have played.

# How It Works
In this app, you can add and track the courses you have played and how you did on them. You can imput the difficulty, the address, give it an overall score, and describe your experience. Simply sign up (It's free!) and start tracking your courses.

## MVP Goals
My MVP goal is to have the app fully functional based on the above description. I would like to be able to let people create an account and have the app store their information. I would like to be able to pull from a golf course API and use that to properly locate the courses based off of the users location

## Technologies Used
Full MVC, Mongoose, Express, Node.js. I will also use Javascript and CSS

## Stretch Goals
I really want to build a fully interactive golf website/app, and would like golf to be the focus of my future projects as well. 

-   With this specific app, I'd eventually like to have users be able to create tee times directly on the app.

-   I'd like users to add comments and reviews of their own to these golf courses. These reviews will update the overall golf course rating.

-   User interactivity. Users will be able to make their own lists of courses they have played and rank and explain them. Users can make this information public and other users will be able to see their lists.
